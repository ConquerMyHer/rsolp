0) Ensure Qt4 is installed and qmake is in your path (Qt 4.8.0 recommended).

1a) Compiling on Windows (using Visual Studio's cl and nmake):
	Open a command prompt and cd to your visual studio C directory, e.g.:
		cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio [10.0]\VC"
		(where [10.0] is replaced by whichever version of Visual Studio you have).
	To put nmake and cl in your path, run the vsvarsall.bat script by typing:
		vcvarsall.bat
	Next, cd to the directory containing this file (INSTALL.txt) and type:
		qmake
		nmake release
	
1b) Compiling on Unix (assuming g++ and make are installed):
	From a terminal, cd to the directory containing this file (INSTALL.txt) and type:
		qmake
		make

1) Compiling on MacOS X:
	From a terminal, cd to the directory containing this file (INSTALL.txt) and type:
		qmake -spec macx-g++
		make
		
2) That's it! You should end up with an exe/binary/bundle named "Compositor" 
	(if compiled on Windows, it will be in the release/ directory).
